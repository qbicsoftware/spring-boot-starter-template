# Spring Boot Starter (template)
A minimal working starter template for Spring Boot applications with a demonstration of Java annotation-based [Inversion of Control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3058/what-is-inversion-of-control) via [Dependency Injection](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130794/what-is-dependency-injection). 

## Run the app

Checkout the latest code from `main` and run the Maven goal `spring-boot:run`:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## What the app does

This small app just parses a file with a collection of good coding prayers and creates a singleton instance of an `CodingPrayersMessageService`. This concrete implementation uses the interface `MessageService`, that comes with only one public method: `String collectMessage()`. 

This service is used to demonstrate the IoC principle. We have defined another interface `NewsMedia` and provide a concrete implementation `DeveloperNews`, that will call the message service to receive recent news and forward them to the caller.

In the main app code, we just retrieve this Singleton instance or Bean in Spring lingua from the loaded context and call the news media `getNEws()` method. The collected message is then printed out to the command line interface:

## Realisation of IoC and DPI

The messages collection is stored in a simple text file `messages.txt`, that is provided with the apps `resources`. Just go ahead and change the content of the file and run the app!

So how does the app know where to find this file and **load the messages content**?

We have configured it as a **external property** in a file `application.properties` and load the configuration on application startup! Cool eh?

<img width="381" alt="grafik" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9976560/142376871-5bee068f-208c-4af0-a35b-9442ee498789.png">

This is how the file content looks like:

```
messages.file=messages.txt
```

So how do we access the value of the `messages.file` property in our application with Spring?

Have a look in the class `AppConfig`, there the magic happens:

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("application.properties")
class AppConfig {

    @Value('${messages.file}')
    public String messagesFile

```

We define the property source, which is the file `application.properties` that is provided in the resource folder of the app and available to the classpath. 
We also tell with the annotation `@Configuration` Spring, hey this is a class that holds app configuration data!

With the annotation `@Value('${messages.file}')` we tell Spring, which property's value should be injected. Here we make use of field injection, other types of injection like method and constructor injection are also possible.

So how is the concrete implementation of the `MessageService` presented to Spring? We can use the `@Bean` annotation here, to tell Spring: _hey, this is sth you must load on startup and provide to the context_.

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("application.properties")
class AppConfig {

    ....

    @Bean
    MessageService messageService() {
        return new CodingPrayersMessageService(messagesFile)
    }
```

That is all there is, you can now load the bean in your main application code:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
class SpringMinimalTemplateApplication {

    static void main(String[] args) {
	SpringApplication.run(SpringMinimalTemplateApplication, args)
	// load the annotation context
	AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class)
	// get the service bean
	MessageService service = context.getBean("messageService", MessageService.class)
	// collect the message and praise the magic
	println service.collectMessage()

```

### Inversion of Control

You might have already spotted the interface `NewsMedia` and its implementing class `DeveloperNews` in the app's source code. Here you can see an example for the magic of inversion of control.

The `NewsMedia` interface is just an abstraction that we will later use, because we don't care about the actual implementation details. By this, we also do not create any dependencies to concrete implementation details but on actual behaviour. Concrete implementations can then later be exchanged without causing any breaking changes in the client code base. 

The interface has only one method: `String getNews()`. Now let's have a closer look into the class `DeveloperNews` that implements this interface:

```java
class DeveloperNews implements NewsMedia{

    private MessageService service

    DeveloperNews(MessageService service) {
        this.service = service
    }

    @Override
    String getNews() {
        return service.collectMessage()
    }
}
```

When you check the constructor signature, you see that this method has only one argument, which is a reference to an object of type `MessageService`. And when the `getNews()` method is called by the client, the class delegates this request to the message service. Since we have stored the reference in a private field, that is super easy, we known how to call the service. 

So why is this inversion of control? 

Because the `DeveloperNews` class does not manage the instantiation of a concrete message service. The configuration happened outside of the class, therefore the DeveloperNews class has no direct control over the instantiation. If it had, it would look like this:

```java
DeveloperNews(String filePathToMessages) {
        this.service = new CodingPrayersMessageService(filePathToMessages)
}
```

That doesn't look good, does it? In order to create an instance of a message service, we would need to know the conrete implementation and its required properties (here it is the file path to the `messages.txt`). So the `DeveloperNews` class has the control over the message service.

Instead, we would like to not take care about these details, so we invert the control and inject the dependency via the constructor.
